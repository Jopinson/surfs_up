# surfs_up
W. Avy has come to me to sort thru a SQLite database of Weather data to determine the best place for their new Surf/Ice-Cream shop. W. Avy wants to look at the weather in Oahu, during the months of June and December, across four years, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Once the query was written we presented it to W. Avy's Investors.

- The average temperature in December in Oahu is 71
- June is a little hotter, its the start of summer. School has ended and tons of families are taking their once a year vacation.
- December is cooler, and likely to have less tourist traffic than June due to the number of Holidays during the month. 
- The ideal weather for eating ice cream is the same as surfing, 70-80 degrees, not hot enough to melt your ice cream or burn you off your board, but still hot enough that an ice cold treat is fantastic or where a nice splash of ocean water cools you off.

Oahu is probably the ideal island to start this franchise of the future, Surf's Up. Tempertures remain around the 70s-80s all year round. There is constantly tourists coming and going from the island. We could run queries on the yearly precipitation in the area, and try to find some smaller items like umbrellas or hot chocolate to make up the loss of income from rainy days. A second query we could create is using the station locations to track wind speed, to try to determine which days are going to be good for surfing.
